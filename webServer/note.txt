!--Route Note
So serve the content of the directory, the path to the fold needs to be a absoute from the root of your machine.
-Node has two varible to help out with this:
__dirname = directory name
__filename = file name

-Relative path to style stylesheet
<link rel="stylesheet" href="./style/style.css">

-Absoute path to style sheet; based of the web server route; the pubilc folder
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/style/style.css">

*Just loading the JS file in index.html file.

!--static mean the elements on the page won't change.
app.use(express.static(publicDirectoryPath));

?--Handle Bar require a views folder in the root directory of the project.

    webServer <--Root
    -node_modules
    -public
    -source
    -views <--Reqired folder
    .gitignore
    note.txt
    package-lock.json
    package.json

*If you want to inject a value in an HBS file, open and close two curly braces.
    -- {{}}

!--Customizing View Directory
To customize the location for the view directory, you have to tell express where to look.
    const viewsPath = path.join((__dirname, '../views')); absoutepath to views directory.
    ../ tell express to go up a directory.


!--Handle Bar Partials's
* Partials's allow us to create little template for part of bigger webpage
* Partials's are kept in a different directory than the views.
Partials still uses the hbs extention.
?What goes inside a partials doc?
    It is just html elements.
    To render a partial, you still use {{}} plue a > in the middle.
    -{{>}}
    After the > symbol, you provide the partial name; ie the file name
    -{{>header}}
    !No path or extention needed.
